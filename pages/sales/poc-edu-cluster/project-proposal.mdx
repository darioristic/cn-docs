## Digital transformation

### Challenges in the transformation process

Today's business depends on the speed of delivery of applications and services that companies need to respond to the challenges of digital transformation. Our customers expect us to change in line with changes in the market, which means that we respond quickly to their request or that we make business processes easy to use. This is a major challenge for development teams and managers.

Let's consider a traditional company such as a bank. Banks have been using IT systems for years. The stability and availability of these systems are essential to the bank's operations. These applications, which have been stable for years, but which do not evolve in terms of functionality and lack of flexibility in the exchange of information with other applications and systems, do not necessarily bring any value to the bank's operations today.

Today, traditional industries such as banks face increasing competition. Not only from other banks, but from small start-up companies, which aim to hit a market that has been stable for many years, and which has not adopted modern technological development and customer demands. These small companies are playing on the expectations of new generations in terms of doing business through digital channels.

In most cases, these start-ups have developed and adapted their solutions to cloud-native technologies from the very beginning. Unlike their competing traditional banks, they gain a great advantage with cloud-native technology because they can move much faster towards their goal – which is as many users as possible. Plus, they're not burdened with a bunch of legacy old apps that they have to worry about in addition to developing a new product.

With the adoption of cloud-native technologies, new digital products can be developed faster, continuously refined, and delivered according to customer needs. This approach reduces the possibility of error, saving money and time. Many traditional companies are experiencing high pressure to digitize their business channels and transform their business.

# What is cloud-native?

Cloud-native technology and architecture is an approach to application development that is designed and engineered to maximize the full benefits of cloud technology. This approach is not new, but lately it has become more and more a strategy for many companies. It is mainly defined by three basic elements: containers, container orchestration, and microservices. In addition to the relationship to technology and infrastructure, an important aspect is also occupied by changes in culture, processes and operations within the company.

## Containers

Containerization is the foundation for a cloud-native approach; containers allow you to pack together everything you need to run an application into a single executable package. This can include things like a Java VM, some kind of server application, and the software itself. The container is highly portable and independent of the environment in which you will run it, so it can run in a virtualized environment. Project Docker is the most popular container product and its name is almost synonymous with containers at the moment.

## Orchestration

Container orchestration is important for a cloud-native approach, as it allows you to automate the management and deployment of your containers through real-time load balancing, which would be virtually impossible to do manually. Container orchestration allows you to monitor the system, balance the load between containers, start and shut down containers in response to specific events. Kubernetes is the standard for orchestration today.

## Microservice

Cloud-native applications are developed as a series of microservices, each of which does one thing and is connected only to the service with which it really needs to exchange data, rather than as large traditional applications where services are part of a monolithic structure. This makes them quick to develop and customize, and also supports the type of horizontal scaling required when user requirements exceed the capacity of a particular microservice. In the cloud model, this approach is efficient and can help reduce monthly costs because increasing capacity for a single microservice is much cheaper than paying extra hardware space for unused parts of a large application or database.

# The Benefits of a Cloud-Native Approach

Companies that are in the process of digital transformation are looking for technical solutions to improve customer experience, operational agility, corporate culture, and leadership, and the integration of technology into their business. The combination of digital technologies can enable change in a strategic and priority way, in line with corporate goals. Key drivers of digital transformation include user behavior, expectations of access to information anytime, anywhere, increasing use of mobile devices, competition in the market, and technical innovation.

## Time to market

The speed with which a company can design, build, and distribute its services has become vital to business growth. The time it takes to bring a new service to market has become a critical difference between innovative companies and those that aren't. Traditional applications have been time-consuming to develop with a complex and time-consuming process of releasing new versions. Today, it is clear that applications need to be portable, secure, easy to upgrade, and easy to maintain. In recent years, the fastest and most effective response to this challenge has been containers and orchestration.

## Increase in productivity

Slow processes for accessing the infrastructure affect the delivery time of a new application. By rapidly adopting new technologies, you allow your development teams not to wait days or weeks to access their necessary resources, but to reduce that time to minutes.

## Transparent costs

Not only do slow down application delivery, but they also carry a big risk for IT departments, as developers can find other and faster ways to get to their cloud environment. It is not uncommon for them to decide to lease services from a public cloud provider on their own. This approach leads to higher and hidden costs for the entire IT. Apart from the uncontrollable expense, these accounts are completely under the radar of the company's investments and investments.

## Better scalability

Automated load scaling processes bring benefits in terms of the availability of your applications. In contrast, manual routine processes of adding new resources are prone to errors, and they can hardly be controlled to prevent something from going wrong in the process. In addition, they generally do not keep up with the growing demand for IT resources, leading to a bottleneck and an even longer waiting period for applications to be delivered.

## Employer attractiveness

In times of staff and skills shortages, being attractive as an employer plays an important role when it comes to hiring IT talent. Young programmers like organizational processes to be agile-oriented, so that they feel that they are making progress on a daily basis. If a company isn't progressive in its organization, it's probably not progressive in its visions or in its use of technology.

# Cloud-native transformation

The benefits of the cloud-native approach are great, but in order to achieve them, the company must develop not only the technological capacity, but also the human aspects, such as culture, processes and management methods. In the process of adopting cloud-native technology, it is necessary to define a well-defined strategy that should include four key elements: people, processes, technologies and operations.

In any project, any one of these elements may require more focus than the other. But if you change one element, it affects all of them. For example, changing processes to support a continuous delivery model requires you to implement a DevOps pipeline with a more security focus, or adding AI services and functionality to your solutions requires new team members with AI expertise and changing the way you operationally manage your platform.

## People

The people component surpasses any other part of the project in terms of importance to success. To achieve business value by adopting a cloud-native approach, teams need to be able to quickly coordinate between business and IT. Teams need to invest in moving to agile methods, adopting DevOps principles and automating the software lifecycle, adopting new roles (such as SRE), and organizations need to give teams the appropriate level of autonomy.

The transformation and adoption of cloud-native technology requires changes in your company's culture. You need to build a culture that encourages cooperation, an open approach, empowers people to embrace innovation, is compatible with business goals and accelerates your ability to deliver innovative solutions for your customers. Create a great place to work that attracts and retains the right people who will allow you to achieve your goals.

We assess skills and identify knowledge gaps. We provide additional training that your talented team members need to be successful in DevOps or SRE roles. We provide opportunities for your team to gain education and experience to fill knowledge gaps.

We will help you create a new team within your company - the Innovation Center. This team works closely with us to develop new solutions and build new skills that are needed to ensure the successful adoption of new technology at the company level. Then, other teams in the company take over the knowledge from the Innovation Center, which works closely with the transformation partner.

## Processes

On the path of transformation in the process of adopting cloud-native technologies, you will be forced to adopt a new methodology. We propose best practices, which provide guiding principles for continuous design and delivery. Train your business leaders, developers, and operations teams to work together using practices that cover the entire digital product lifecycle. Adopt agile practices for planning, development, operations, and infrastructure optimization.

Design thinking is a powerful approach to innovation and brand differentiation that focuses on creating an engaged customer experience and getting customer feedback at every step of your solution.

Agile development produces software in short iterations with the goal of continuous delivery. We advise you on how to adopt best practices that describe the iterative development and use of automation to ensure quality.
# Hybrid Multicloud Solutions

Your development teams are constantly working on the integrations needed to connect new cloud-native applications with outdated on-premise applications. We help you choose the right API strategy to easily connect all your applications.

## Technology

Establish an overall vision of cloud technology and your capabilities. Consider the desired state and establish business goals for your infrastructure and data. Why do you want to use new technology? Here we can help you how to make the most of the potential of the knowledge gained through training and consulting. We help you to assess your skills and identify gaps in knowledge.

A hybrid multi-cloud environment is definitely a common choice of infrastructure platform in most enterprise companies. We help you get the most out of your platform, choosing the best architecture and approach to support the most critical application requirements.

Do you want to explore new technologies, such as blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT)? Use them to improve applications and develop new ones. We are ready to help you with clear guidance from our previous experiences with other clients.

## Operations

One of the biggest challenges companies face as they migrate to the cloud is moving from a traditional IT operating model to a cloud-based self-service model. If we look at the graph below, from left to right in the code of traditional IT, the responsibilities are clear. The App Team looks after the application layer, the Infrastructure Team has all the infrastructure components, and the Data Team has the data. 

For decades, this traditional IT model has worked in a way that mitigates the risk of loss of application availability, as well as a clear division of responsibilities between individual teams within the company. It is derived from ITIL and On-Premises technology solutions.

In an attempt to solve this, companies are resorting to DevOps practices that impose themselves as a possible solution. However, the standard mistake that is usually made is implementing a DevOps team, rather than adopting a DevOps culture.

# Project methodology

Your starting point and final destination of the cloud-native journey will be unique in line with your business vision and business capabilities. We propose a transformation approach through modernization, focusing on understanding your current service portfolio, current market position and future ambitions.

In order to better adapt to the specifics of your business and vision, we have divided the project into four main phases: 

1. Analysis
2. Implementation
3. Education
4. Support

## Analysis

Over the past years, the Cloud Native d.o.o. team has been carefully working on the analysis of many companies that had the ambition to adopt cloud-native technologies. We have identified common challenges faced by companies in different sectors, as well as ways to overcome them, or simply avoid them.

### Interactive workshops

Through a series of workshops in a physical or virtual space, we map your current situation, set a strategy aligned with your business goals. Together with you, we create your roadmap for transformation to a cloud-native organization. We help you define your vision for cloud-native adoption, including your business goals and organizational transformation plans. We discuss goals, approaches, possible solutions, and next steps.

### Content of the workshops

We strive to identify challenges, potential issues, approaches to technology, necessary stakeholders, and desired outcomes. We are working on displaying the structure of the current state, the target state, and the possibilities for change. A series of interviews to assess your team's abilities, skills, and processes.

### What We Deliver

- Analysis of the current situation, architecture and organizational practice for migration.
- A strategy for people, processes and technology.
- A definition of an architecture that relates to target environments.

## Implementation

The implementation of the OpenShift platform provides an environment for the development and use of microservices as a paradigm for developing new and transforming existing applications. The implemented solution includes an education platform that aims to provide a central place where the modernization of the application begins and where teams can practice their knowledge acquired through the training phase. The implementation is done closely with a multi-functional team within your company, who can stop the process at any time and start a discussion with us in order to clarify the current operation. The composition of this team is created in the analysis phase, and later it can be expanded to more stakeholders within the company.

### Red Hat OpenShift Orchestration Platform

One of the main reasons why developers love cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud is that they can access a wide variety of resources and services within minutes. In many cases, developers working in large companies are not allowed to independently manage resources belonging to the company. To help companies adopt a cloud-native approach, Red Hat has developed a solution called OpenShift with a vision to provide companies with a universal cloud solution, whether operating in an on-premise or public cloud environment. 

The installation of the OpenShift Educational Cluster for this project is recommended on a VMware Virtual Environment or other supported virtualization.
