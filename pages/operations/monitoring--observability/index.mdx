# Monitoring & Observability

Monitoring and observability provide insights into the health and performance of the cluster, applications, and infrastructure.

## Metrics and Alerts
Prometheus and Alertmanager are commonly used to track resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network) and trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Logging
Centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Loki, or OpenShift Logging simplifies troubleshooting and compliance auditing by storing application and system logs in a structured way.

## Tracing
Distributed tracing tools like Jaeger help identify latency issues across microservices, improving the overall developer experience.

## Dashboards
Grafana dashboards and OpenShift Console provide real-time visualizations, empowering teams to react quickly to anomalies.
