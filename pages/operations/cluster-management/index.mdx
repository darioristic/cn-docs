# Cluster Management

Effective cluster management is the foundation of stable OpenShift and Kubernetes operations.  
It ensures that the platform runs smoothly, securely, and at scale while meeting business requirements.

## Node Lifecycle Management
Managing nodes is critical for maintaining a healthy cluster. This includes provisioning, scaling, and decommissioning nodes as workloads grow or shrink. Automated tools help simplify this process.

## Resource Quotas and Limits
Defining quotas and limits ensures fair resource distribution among teams and prevents one application from consuming excessive resources.

## Configuration Management
Consistency is achieved through GitOps practices and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), reducing configuration drift and making environments reproducible.

## Multi-Cluster Management
In enterprise environments, multiple clusters are often deployed across regions or clouds. Tools like Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) centralize governance and policy enforcement.
