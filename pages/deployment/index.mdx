## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture defines how your OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster is structured, including control plane, worker nodes, and infrastructure nodes.

- **Control Plane:** Managed by Master nodes
- **Application Workloads:** Managed by Worker nodes
- **Infrastructure & Storage Services:** Managed by Infra nodes

### Recommended Topology

- **3 Master nodes** for high availability  
- **3 Worker nodes** for application workloads  
- **3 Infrastructure nodes** for storage and cluster services  

> See the [Resources](./resources) page for detailed node specifications.

## Deployment Models

You can choose deployment models based on your business and technical requirements:

- **On-Premises:** Full control and security over physical infrastructure.  
- **Cloud:** Managed deployment with automatic updates and scalability.  
- **Hybrid:** Combination of on-premises and cloud resources.  
- **Edge:** Distributed deployment for low-latency or remote environments.  

---

## Deployment Strategies

Effective deployment strategies reduce downtime and improve reliability:

- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Deploy new versions in parallel, switch traffic seamlessly.  
- **Rolling Updates:** Gradual updates across nodes with minimal service disruption.  
- **Canary Releases:** Deploy to a small subset of users first to test new features.  
- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines:** Integrate GitOps tools for repeatable, version-controlled deployments.  

---

## Cluster Nodes & Resources

Refer to the [Resources](./resources) page for detailed node specifications. Typical setup includes:

- Master nodes for control plane  
- Worker nodes for applications  
- Infra/Storage nodes for persistent storage and cluster services  

---

## Infrastructure & Network Planning

- **Networking:** Separate management, application, and storage networks  
- **Load Balancing:** Use HAProxy or OpenShift Router for high availability  
- **Storage:** Deploy OpenShift Data Foundation or alternative persistent storage solutions  

---

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

- Deploy **odd number of Master nodes** for quorum  
- Enable **etcd backups** and offsite replication  
- Configure **multi-zone or multi-region clusters** for critical applications  

---

## Best Practices

- Use **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** for repeatable deployments  
- Monitor cluster health using Prometheus and Grafana  
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for security  
- Automate **backup and recovery procedures**  

---

> **Tip:** Always test deployments in a **staging environment** before production rollout.
